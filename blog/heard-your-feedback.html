We’ve got some great feedback from you over the last few weeks. We’ve taken this feedback seriously and we’re making these changes to support your requirements. </p>



<p class="blog-section-subheading">1. Add funds shows your outstanding as well as allowed ads limit.</p><p class="blog-content"> Typically your COD balance is not fully utilizable for ads balance because some part of it may have already been paid out. We’ve updated our add funds screen to show you the available outstanding vs the allowed limit so that you can add the allowed amount of money and proceed to advertise.</p><p class="blog-content">
Editing of Cost Per click for each campaign is a highly requested feature and this is coming soon to the ads panel.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">2. Transaction History shows daily summary as opposed to transaction summaries.</p><p class="blog-content"> 
We’ve reduced the amount of transactions shown and instead shown to you the amount of daily debits done against the ad wallet balance.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">3. Hiding previously promoted products.</p><p class="blog-content"> 
If you don’t want to see out of stock or previously added products, you can choose to hide them from the status field and view them only if you want to see hidden products. You can always add hidden products again to start promoting them again. Note: Previous historical data does not get deleted even if you hide the product. </p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">Upcoming changes</p><p class="blog-content"> 
We’re also coming up with new dashboards, advanced panel for sellers as well as other great features that will help you promote your products with ease.
