<p class="blog-heading" >
There are a number of factors that lead to a high performing ad. We looked at tens of thousands of campaigns and based on the data, we have decided to publish best practices for product ads to deliver the best results for you. </p>
<p class="blog-content">
If the ad is not performing, your ad campaigns will not be effective and might not deliver the desired results. This is the only reason as a seller, that you would be worried about when delivering advertising.

                                               	<br/>

Infact, we would suggest that your promotional pricing has to be in effect for your ads to start working, because users need a reason to select your product as opposed to others and a better pricing for ads is recommended.</td>

Ideally you should promote as many as products in your catalogue as possible.

<br/><strong>
In order to get more clicks, and higher visibility it is recommended that you update the cost per click to a higher price.</strong><br/>

For example if Rs 2 is not working, then it is recommended that you modify this price to Rs 2.50 or Rs 3.00 so that you can see what impact it has. </td>
