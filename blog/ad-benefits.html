<p class="blog-heading">New sellers on any e-commerce platform have a very specific challenge - how to start getting orders and grow their business quickly.
</p>
<p class="blog-content">Advertising is especially relevant in this context because of couple of reasons:</p>
<p class="blog-content">
Firstly, it gives sellers enhanced visibility that helps tackle already entrenched competition. Advertising helps in giving visibility beyond what would be organically possible. New sellers don't have rating and great order history to boast off. Advertising helps such sellers get traction with users and eventually helps them get a sizable order volume. </p>
<p class="blog-content">Secondly, advertising could provide a fast track to build online reputation which in turn drives higher sales organically. New sellers who are advertising are better placed (literally) to get orders compared to others. This visibility leads to higher than usual order volumes that eventually translates into a rating and order history for sellers. With decent rating and order history in place, seller is all set to get even more orders based on their online reputation.</p>

<p class="blog-content">While Advertising is not the only thing that helps build a sustainable business, it is indeed a very important investment which can help new sellers grow quickly and eventually drive organic sales.</p>
