<p class="blog-heading">Snapdeal has always focused on empowering sellers to make meaningful connect with consumers to help drive more sales. We recently launched yet another such feature in our Ads platform that allows sellers to advertise their products to specific shoppers based on their buying behavior.
</p>
<p class="blog-content">Sellers can now create Cost Per View (CPV) campaign through which they would be able to advertise their products to following segment of shoppers:</p>
<p class="blog-content">
Shoppers who viewed seller's advertised products earlier </p>
<p class="blog-content">Shoppers who bought products in target product categories in the past</p>

<p class="blog-content">CPV campaigns are charged on the basis of views where price of the campaign is to be specified 'per thousand views' of ad. For example, if CPV price specified for a campaign is Rs. 15, seller will be charged Rs. 15 for every 1000 views of product being advertised in the campaign.</p>

<p class="blog-content">With CPV campaigns, sellers can expect more visibility for their products and capture mind space of highly relevant segment of shoppers. </p>

<p class="blog-content">To create CPV campaigns, simply choose 'Cost Per View' option in the campaign type while creating your campaigns.
Common questions around CPV campaigns are covered in the FAQ section of Ads website. Please feel free to write to 'adsales@snapdeal.com' for any additional queries. </p>
