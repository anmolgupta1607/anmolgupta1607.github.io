<p class="blog-heading">In an effort to bring experience enriching features to Snapdeal Ads' users, payments have been turned online.</p>
<p class="blog-content">Snapdeal Ads is now integrated with Freecharge online payment services. You can choose to directly pay through credit card, debit card or simply net banking.</p>
<p class="blog-content">No need to ensure that you have adequate COD balance. Whenever the funds are low, just click on ‘Add Funds’ option on top right corner, enter amount and other payment details to keep advertising.</p>

<p class="blog-content">You can still choose to pay complete or partial amount by COD balance. Snapdeal Ads recommend the maximum amount that can be paid using COD balance, one can freely opt for it.</p>

<p class="blog-content">With online option in place, it takes only few minutes to complete the payment instead of days and weeks taken by NEFT or cheque modes of payment.</p>

<p class="blog-content">Security of transactions is also improved as Freecharge is a secured service which codes your payment information before sending it online. Moreover, there is less chance of misplacement of cheque or transfer to the wrong account. </p>

<p class="blog-content">We hope integration with online payment system will make your interaction with Snapdeal Ads smoother and better.</p>
