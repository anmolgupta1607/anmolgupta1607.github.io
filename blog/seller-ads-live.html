<p  class="blog-heading"> We are pleased to share that after successful beta round Snapdeal Ads Version 2 is live for every seller now.</p>
    <p class="blog-content">With it come powerful capabilities - </p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">1) Set and control CPC Bid, Total Budget and Daily Budget </p><p class="blog-content">
	As a seller, one would want to manipulate various levers to reach out to maximum number of consumers. Configure CPC Bid to control display frequency of your ads. You can also restrain distribution of ads display across the campaign period by allocating daily budget. Total budget will help you manage funds across different campaigns. </p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">2) Advertise multiple products in one go using campaigns</p><p class="blog-content">
	Creating multiple campaigns for every product was definitely difficult. To make things smooth and easy for you, now you can choose multiple products for a campaign. Simply go to the ‘Products’ tab and select the products you want to combine in a campaign.</p>
<p class="blog-content">Tip: In a campaign, always combine products from the same category. Helps make your ads more effective and improve click through rates.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">3) Smartly decide CPC Bid to display more ads than your competitors</p>
<p class="blog-content">CPC Bid gives you the power to beat your competition. More the amount of bid, more often your ads will be displayed to the consumers. A higher bid compared to competitor sellers gets your ads priority above their ads. Use this feature strategically in highly competitive categories.</p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">4) Target buyers from specific cities</p><p class="blog-content"> 
	Another strategic feature, It lets you invest money where you think it will be best utilized. You can choose to get your ads displayed only in specific regions of the country. Why advertise sweaters in Mumbai, when we already know winters hardly visit the city.</p>
<img class="blog-image" width= 720px; height= 450px; src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/graphic3.png">
<p class="blog-section-subheading">5) Use elaborate charts and reports to measure your ads performance</p>
<p class="blog-content">As you strategically use various options again and again, you would want to know their impact and make further changes to ad campaigns. You can check no. of ads that were displayed (impressions), no. of clicks and then finally sales which actually happened. Reports section lets you monitor the performance in in your preferred view – Graph or Table – as well as duration – Weeks, Months or Custom.</p>
