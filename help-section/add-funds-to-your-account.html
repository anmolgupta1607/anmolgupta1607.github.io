	<p><strong>CoD outstanding</strong> is the total sales youâ€™ve made through CoD after your last payment. This is same as the amount you see on your Seller Panel.</p>
	<p><strong>Ads limit</strong> is 30% of CoD outstandings. This is capped to this amount to ensure that it is recoverable from your next payment.</p>

	<p>Here you can view a daily summary of all your debit and credit transactions.
<br/>
Any funds that a seller adds towards ads are shown as credits and or any funds used towards displaying ads are shown as debits here.
<br/>
Debits are done on a daily basis, so if all total spends in a day were about Rs 5000, you will see a Rs 5000 debit in the Transaction history page. </p> <img class="screenshot cast-shadow" src="/img/helpnavimg32.png">
