<p class="blog-section-subheading">What are the criteria for running ads on snapdeal?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Sellers need to have an assortment of fresh (new) or well rated (2.5 and above) products. In general – you can promote everything but the ads platform will prioritize and only serve new products or rated (2.5 and above) products.</p>
<p class="blog-content">Seller rating is not a criteria anymore for ad serving.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">I’m already a seller selling on snapdeal, do I have to register separately for advertising?</p>
<p class="blog-content">No. You can use your existing seller login credentials to advertise on Snapdeal.</p>

<!-- <p class="blog-section-subheading">How do my ads appear? </p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">I have logged into the site and do not see my ads. Why is it so?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Your products share the space with thousands of other sellers, so it may not appear every time you see. But be rest assured, your products are being displayed to buyers in a process that is automatic and ensures as many products as possible are advertised.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">How does Snapdeal charge the seller for Advertising?</p>
<p class="blog-content">There are two kinds of pricing: Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per View (CPV).</p>
<p class="blog-content">CPC is charged only when the user clicks on the product ads.</p>
<p class="blog-content">CPV is charged when the user sees the product ads. This is a special ad unit that allows sellers to target customers with advanced targeting options. </p>


<p class="blog-section-subheading">How do I know where do my ads get served?</p>
<p class="blog-content" >Your product ads by default would serve only on the same category as of advertised product. You can also select anyother category if you feel it is relevant to your product.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">How do I pay?</p>
<p class="blog-content" >Snapdeal ads uses your COD balance as a mechanism to pay for advertising. Typically, you can use upto 30% of your available COD balance to be transferred as a part of ads.</p>
<p class="blog-content" style="margin-bottom:90px">Alternatively, you can use credit cards to pay for ads. </p>
