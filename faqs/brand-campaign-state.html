<p class="blog-section-subheading">How can I create a campaign?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Creating a campaign is simple. Once you get your account created on Snapdeal Ads, login to the platform and follow these simple steps - <br/><br/>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
<li>1) Click on 'Create Banner Campaign'.</li>

<li>2) Enter basic details such as campaign name, RO number of the agreement with Snapdeal and the dates for the campaign.</li>

<li>3) Next select the platform and pages you want to display your ads on.</li>

<li>4) Choose the adspaces which you want to target.</li>

<li>5) Upload the creative of respective sizes.</li>
<li>6) If you want to target pages of specific categories only, choose the same.</li>
<li>5) You can also choose the cities in which you want your ads to be shown.</li>
<li>5) Select the day parting to let you campaigns run through certain times of the day only.</li>
<li>5) Finally, go to campaign list, click on the status and submit your campaign.</li>

Once your campaign is submitted, our ad ops team reviews the creative and approves it to go live usually within 24 hours. In case there are any issues with the creative, our ad ops team will contact you directly .
</p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">Can I start, stop my campaigns?</p>
<p class="blog-content">You can pause or run your campaigns at anytime. If all the products of your campaign go out of stock or are not live, or campaign budget is complete, or end date is reached, or funds are complete, campaign is paused automatically.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">Can I delete my campaign if I no longer want to run it?</p>
<p class="blog-content">You can delete your campaign at anytime. This only deletes the campaign from your view but campaign metrics are not lost ever. You can also view the deleted campaign at anytime but cannot start them again.</p>
