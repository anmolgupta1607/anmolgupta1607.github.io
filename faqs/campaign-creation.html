<p class="blog-section-subheading">What is an ad campaign?</p>
<p class="blog-content">An ad campaign is a promotion that you run for your products. An ad campaign can have a start date (typically today), end date, budget, daily budget and the list of products or categories of products that are there within your assortment.</p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">How do I create a campaign?</p>
<p class="blog-content">You can visit your advertising panel and click on “Start advertising” to create a campaign.</p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">What is a bid price?</p>
<p class="blog-content">A bid price is an indicative price per click (or per view) at which your campaigns will be served.  Typically, ads are served using an auction process and the bid price decides whose ads will be placed.</p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">What happens if I increase my bid price?</p>
<p class="blog-content">A better bid price ensures that you win the auction and increases the chances of placement of your ad campaign.</p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">Can I add multiple products in a campaign?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Yes, you can add as many products as you want in a campaign by simply clicking on each product.</p>
<p class="blog-content">
You can also target by the whole category.</p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">Is selection of products better or selection of categories better?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Ideally, we recommend you to add as much as assortment as possible for your campaign.  This improves your chances of getting seen and increases the overall impact of the advertising. </p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">Can I advertise a product which is not listed on Snapdeal?</p>
<p class="blog-content">No. You can only advertise products listed on Snapdeal.</p>
<p class="blog-section-subheading">Do I need to manually pause my ads if product goes out of stock or is not live?</p>
<p class="blog-content">We automatically pause your product ad as soon as it either goes goes out of stock or is not live on Snapdeal anymore. This helps you save clicks.</p>
