<p class="blog-section-subheading">What is a recurring campaign?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Snapdeal ads now supports recurring campaigns as the default choice of campaigns. With this feature, advertising is not disrupted if campaigns run out of budget.</p>
<p class="blog-content">By setting a weekly (more options coming) recurring top-up of an amount, once the campaign amount is exhausted, campaigns will automatically debit from your COD balance to add to the campaign budget.</p>
<p class="blog-content">So for example if you set Rs 5000 as your weekly budget for your campaign, upon exhaustion of the budget  - your COD balance will automatically be debited by Rs 5000 and your campaign will continue to run.</p>
<p class="blog-content">Your campaign would never stop running as long as you have sufficient CoD Outstandings, till you either pause or delete campaign.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">How would the money be deducted for recurring payment?</p>
<p class="blog-content">For all campaigns setup on recurring top-up, if there is not sufficient balance in your ads account, your CoD outstanding would be charged for the amount needed to run your campaigns setup for auto weekly top-up - your next payment cycle.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">How can I stop recurring campaigns?</p>
