<p class="blog-section-subheading">When I check the website, why do I see someone else's ads instead of mine?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Multiple campaigns from different Brands keep running on the same ad slots. Snapdeal Ads

platform, allocates page views among these campaigns depending upon campaign targeting and

goals.
<br/> You are most likely to see your ad if you refresh the page multiple times.

Also, make sure that category, location, day-time targeting is configured appropriately.</p>
