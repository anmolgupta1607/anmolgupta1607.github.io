<p class="blog-section-subheading">I have logged into the site and do not see my ads. Why is it so?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Your products share the space with thousands of other sellers, so it may not appear every time you see. But be rest assured, your products are being displayed to buyers in a process that is automatic and ensures as many products as possible are advertised.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">How does Snapdeal charge the seller for Advertising?</p>
<p class="blog-content">Snapdeal ads charges seller on cpc basis, that is seller pays only when user clicks on the ad advertised by the seller.</p>

<p class="blog-section-subheading">How do I know where do my ads get served?</p>
<p class="blog-content" style="margin-bottom:90px">Your product ads by default would serve only on the same category as of advertised product. You can also select anyother category if you feel it is relevant to your product.</p>
