<p class="blog-content">Create campaign by clicking on Create Campaign button and fill in the basic details.</p>
 <img class="blog-image" src="/img/helpnavimg20.png">
 <p class="blog-section-subheading">Step 1: Overview</p>
 <p class="blog-content">This is super simple. We’ve entered few basic details for you. You can edit the name of your campaign, set the total budget, change the CPC value and select a date range. If you want to cap the per day spends you can also set up a daily budget.</p>

<p class="blog-content"><strong>Total Budget:</strong> It is the maximum spend on the campaign. In case either of the budget or ad balance runs out, your campaign would stop serving.</p>
<p class="blog-content"><strong>Daily Budget:</strong> This defines the maximum spend of the campaign in a day with overspent limit of +10%. With daily budget you can distribute your campaign spends over the desired duration. This only serves as an upper limit and not necessitates that your ads would be served for the specified amount as ad serving depends on lot of other factors.</p>
<p class="blog-content"><strong>CPC bid:</strong> This is the amount you’ll be charged for every click on ad of one of the products in the campaign. Increasing the bid increases your chances of your ad serving.</p>
<p class="blog-content"><strong>Date Range:</strong> You can specify any future date range for your campaign.</p>

  <p class="blog-section-subheading">Step 2: Product</p>
   <p class="blog-content">Select products for advertising from your already listed products on Snapdeal. You can search your products by SUPC or product name.</p>

  <p class="blog-section-subheading">Step 3: Location</p>
   <p class="blog-content">This is optional step. By default your campaign is served across all India. Incase you want to limit your campaign to select locations as you may not be selling everywhere, this step helps you select where all your ads would appear.</p>

     <p class="blog-section-subheading">Step 4: Target Audience</p>
   <p class="blog-content">This is again an optional step. System has inbuilt intelligence to decide where all to serve ads. If you want to select additional categories for targeting, select the categories here. Don’t worry about inconsistent targeting. System has a check to ensure that the ads are served only on relevant categories. If all the minimal fields are filled in, clicking on Done activates the campaign. Your ads would start delivering from start date.</p>

    <p class="blog-content">Till you click Done campaign would remain in Draft state, i.e., ads would not start serving.</p>
