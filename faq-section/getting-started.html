                            <p> You can select as many products as you may want to be advertised. Higher number of products increases chances of receiving clicks and subsequent sales. </p>

                        <div class="content2">
                            <p> High number of clicks indicates that buyers find your products interesting. Lower sales could be because of multiple factors – incorrect pricing, poor product reviews, all sizes or colours not available, inadequate product description, etc. </p>

                            <p> In all likelihood, your ads are running on Snapdeal which you can track via your advertising dashboard. If in case your advertising dashboard shows no clicks on your products, it could be because your competing sellers have bid a higher price per click. You may want to try increasing your cost per click value. Alternately, you can wait till your products start showing up at the same per click price. </p>

                        <div class="content2">
                            <p> You should ideally choose your bestselling products or high potential products to benefit most from promotions. Other factors such as price point, season, etc. also need to be kept in mind. Alternately, you may let Snapdeal choose the products for you and optimize your campaign. </p>

                            <p> Your ad is eligible to be displayed as soon as you have advertising credits in your ad wallet. However, it could not immediately show up at times because of limited clicks purchased or a low per click price. </p>

                        <div class="content2">
                            <p> You can see the benefits of advertising by directly looking at the ads panel reports. They will indicate the number of sales driven by advertising sales.
                                <br/> Sometimes, these sales happen several days after you advertised, so it is good to consistently review these numbers on a daily basis for a period of 30 days after you have advertised. </p>

                        <div class="content2">
                            <p> The duration of ads depends on the amount of clicks purchased. Your ads will stop running as soon as you exhaust your quota of clicks. You can begin your campaign again by adding credits to your ad wallet. </p>

                                <br/> Your products maybe out of stock or not live.
